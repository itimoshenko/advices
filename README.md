# EclecticIQ UI Engineer Code Challenge

We have developed a small application that is functional but naively written.

## What is expected from you?

We would like you to elaborate on two topics:

1. Which parts of the application can be improved and why?
2. How would you test this application and which strategies would you use?

## What should you deliver?

The format is totally up to you. It can be a simple document, like in a code review, or you can fork it and implement your solutions on top of it, or even record a screencast! Whatever suits you best.

## Info about the application

If you would like to mess around with the application, make sure to "Disable cache" on your browser's network settings. Otherwise, API requests will be cached, and it will take a while for their responses to expire.
